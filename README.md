# ergo-oracle-tools-js
Wasm/JS library to perform pool launching steps requiring interaction with the network (described [here](https://github.com/ergoplatform/oracle-core/blob/master/oracle-pool-bootstrap/manual-pool-bootstrap-instructions.md)).
Will benefit from a dapp connector to enable pool owner to sign certain transactions.
